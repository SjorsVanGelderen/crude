# CRUDE

This is a prototype of an application providing CRUD operations powered by Elm.
Keep in mind that this is NOT a scaffolder; it provides the operations and corresponding interface at run-time.

I will probably add a Haskell-powered back-end at some point.
Main target will be PostgreSQL for now.
